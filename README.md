## 👉 Description

This is the source code for the project week 2021 at the "Elektronikschule Tettnang". It is the game "Othello" or also called "Reversi".

### How does Othello works? 
On an 8×8 board, players take turns placing tiles whose sides are colored differently (black and white). <br> One player ("White") always places his piece with the white side up, <br>the other ("Black") with the black side down. At the beginning of the game, <br>there are four pieces in a given order on the board.<br>
A player must place his stone on an empty square,
that is horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to an already occupied square. <br>If a tile
is placed, all opposing tiles that are between the new tile<br> and a tile of the own color that has already been placed. Moves,
that do not result in the flipping of any of the opponent's pieces are not allowed.<br> The goal
of the game is to have as many pieces of your own color on the board as possible.
